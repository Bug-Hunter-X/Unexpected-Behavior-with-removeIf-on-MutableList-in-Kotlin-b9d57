This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Kotlin involving the `removeIf` function on a `MutableList`. The issue arises when the list is modified concurrently or unexpectedly while `removeIf` is operating on it.  The provided code example shows the potential for unexpected results. The solution offers a safer approach using an iterator to avoid concurrent modification issues.
